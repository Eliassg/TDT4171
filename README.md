## Course content
This course is a continuation of TDT4136 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. The three main ways of reasoning (rule-based, model-based, and case-based), will be discussed, with most focus given to model-based reasoning. In particular, we work with reasoning based with uncertain and/or partly missing information, as well as the basis for learning systems (machine learning). The reasoning frameworks that are most prominent in the course are Bayesian networks and decision graphs, but an introduction to neural networks is also included.
